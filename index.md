* Lab 2 

    Lab 2 Part 1 and Part 2 was one my favorites because it introduced me into the basics of coding. Part 1 had me utilize the order of operations and a mathematical equation to create a function that prints out the answer. Part 2 required me to use strings, out and in statements to write a sentence.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 Part 1 was one of my favorites because I found the ability to code measurement volumes to be interesting. The concept behind how every measurement leads to another measurement is fascinating and being able to code it using functions is enjoyable. Starting from milliliters, I had to determine every value that leads up to cup.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 Part 1 and Part 2 was a favorite because of how it was a more complex version of a previous lab my partner and I had done before. In part 1, It had the elements as well as the file type, however, we had to incorporate loops as well as statements within the code. Part 2 was the same, but it was more of a challenge as it was longer, and we had to code the blackjack game using loops as well.
